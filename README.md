# Little-Free-Kindness
<p>
Take a kind note, leave a kind note! The idea behind this project was inspired by Little Free Libraries, which I highly recommend you take a look at.
</p>
<p> All you need to do is submit a nice message, and then you'll be randomly given someone else's message to view. It's a simple concept, but I firmly believe in the notion a small act of kindness can go a long way.
</p>
<p> This project is WIP, but feel free to <a href="https://lfk-stage.herokuapp.com"> check out </a> the progress of the site.
